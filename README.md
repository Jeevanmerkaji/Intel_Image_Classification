# Intel_Image_Classification
"Deep learning-based image classification on the Intel dataset using pretrained CNN models (like VGG16 and ResNet) with Keras.

# Overview 
This repository contains a deep learning-based approach to classify images from the Intel dataset using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG16 and ResNet, implemented in Keras.

# Dataset 
The Intel Image Classification dataset comprises images of natural scenes from around the world. It includes six categories: buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, sea, and streets.

# Features 
Pretrained Models: Utilizes powerful pretrained models like VGG16 and ResNet for feature extraction and classification.

Keras Implementation: Easy-to-follow and modular codebase built with Keras for extensibility and rapid experimentation.
Transfer Learning: Leverages transfer learning to achieve high accuracy with minimal training time.

# Results 
The model achieved an accuracy of  on the test set.
