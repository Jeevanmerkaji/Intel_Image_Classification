# Malaria-Cell-Image-classification
Image classsification task using Malaria Cell Image dataset available on Kaggle

1. First approach is done using the standard convolutional layers using dropout, batch normalization.(The code is inspired from the internet).
2. In the second approach transfer learning is used to classify the images using ResNet50.

The part of the code is sourced from : Bhattiprolu, S. (2023, August 23). 330 - Fine tuning Detectron2 for instance segmentation using custom data [Video]. YouTube. https://youtu.be/cEgF0YknpZw
